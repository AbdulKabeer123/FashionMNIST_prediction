# Fashion Forward AI Garment Classifier

Fashion Forward is a new AI-based e-commerce clothing retailer. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately categorizing images of clothing items into distinct garment types. This will streamline the process of new product listings, making it easier for customers to find what they're looking for and assisting in inventory management.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Implement a garment classifier using image classification techniques.
- **Dataset:** FashionMNIST dataset from PyTorch's torchvision library.
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall.

## Files and Directories

- **`main.py`:** Python script containing the main code for model training and evaluation.
- **`data/`:** Directory to store the FashionMNIST dataset.
- **`models.py`:** Python script defining the CNN model class.
- **`requirements.txt`:** File listing required Python packages and their versions.



## Model Architecture

The model architecture is defined in `models.py`. It consists of a convolutional layer, ReLU activation, max pooling, flattening, and a fully connected layer.

## Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated on the test set.

## Results

The final results, including accuracy, precision per class, and recall per class, are printed after evaluating the model on the test set.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters for better performance.
- Explore data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
